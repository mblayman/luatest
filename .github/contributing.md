# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in luatest.
Here are some ground rules for contributing
to this project.

1. Be kind. This is a volunteer project. Please set your expectations appropriately.
2. Got a feature? Come talk! File an issue in GitHub and we can discuss.
   This project will attempt to stay very tight on features,
   so please come discuss before (potentially) wasting your time on a PR
   that won't be accepted.
3. PRs *must* come with test code to verify changes.
4. Code coverage must be 100%. *No exceptions.*
